In this lab, we were tasked with setting up our Haply device, getting the software running, and modifying an existing example to make our own maze. I ran into a few issues during assembly, the biggest one being that the screwdriver included in the Haply kit was too small for the screws. I ended up buying a T6 screwdriver at home depot which did the trick (Thank you Linnea!)

I used this stack overflow post [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34842502/processing-how-do-i-make-an-object-move-in-a-circular-path]] as reference for the math of how to make the point move in a circular path.
