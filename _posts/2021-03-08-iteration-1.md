This iteration, my team and I started by brainstorming what we wanted to achieve with our project. We came up with a list of wants, needs, and nice to haves. 

**Need to have**
  - User-driven exploration
  - Tempo-driven guidance
  - Inspiration: going over scores in choir
  - Music reading
  - Support for note duration, tempo, pitch
**Want to have**
  - Music editing
  - Support for common accidentals (sharps/flats)
  - “Sticky track” to show where lines are in the music (basically a bump you cross when you go between spots in music)
**Nice to have**
  - Drag and drop functionality for haply for music editing
  - Pared down interface (focus on fundamentals, so maybe only show melody…)
  - Ability to import a song and isolate the melody (at this point this is really blue sky thinking)

Based on these goals, we decided to 

See my code below:
{% highlight processing%}
  double durationMs() {
    Fraction shape= this.getDuration();
    System.out.println("dalmation: "+shape);
    //the calls for time signature and tempo are probably wrong
    OrderedMusicElement e = (OrderedMusicElement) this;
    double tempo = e.parent.tempo;
    System.out.println("Tempo: "+tempo);
    OrderedMusicElement tsObj = e.getPrevious(TimeSignature.class);
    Fraction tsFrac;
    if (tsObj != null) {
      TimeSignature ts = (TimeSignature) e.getPrevious(TimeSignature.class);
      println("Time sig:", ts.num, ts.den);
      tsFrac = Fraction.of(1, ts.den);
    }
    else {
      tsFrac = Fraction.of(1, 4);
    }
    double durationMs = 60/tempo;
    Fraction shape2timeFrac= (shape.divide(tsFrac));
    System.out.println("shape2time: "+shape2timeFrac);
    double shape2time= ((double) shape2timeFrac.getNumerator())/((double) shape2timeFrac.getDenominator());
    durationMs= durationMs*shape2time*1000;
    System.out.println("duration: "+durationMs);
    return durationMs;
  }
