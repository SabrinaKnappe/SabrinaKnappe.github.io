For this lab, we were tasked with making three no-tech human actuated sketches that produce different type of motion. One should move 1mm, one 10mm, and one 100mm. I started by drawing out some ideas.

Next, I gathered my materials for further inspiration.

My first attempt was to make a breath-actuated wind tunnel, which would allow you to move a wooden ball up a clear tube. I taped a straw into the tube so that the breath would be move directed.

I had originally planned this to be the 10mm example, but I didn't anticipate how easy it would be to move the ball, so this became my 100mm sketch. I marked the 100mm mark on the tube.

This video shows the contraption in action, you can see that it works pretty well, although it took some trial and error with breath control to get the ball to hit near the right mark.

Next I wanted to make a system that would allow you to "walK" a two legged wooden block across a surface. This was originally my 100mm sketch, but I think it works well for 10mm, since you move the block further but in small increments that are close to 10mm. I started by cutting the flaps off of a box and then cutting slits in the sides that I could run string through.

Next I needed to attach string to each of the legs of my block. I initially tried attaching them with scotch tape, but this didn't adhere well enough to the wood, so when I tried to "walk" the figure, the string came right off and the block fell over. I solved this by glueing the string to the wood with hot glue.

I then threaded the strings on each side through the slits I cut earlier. In the following video you can see the pulling motion used to "walk" the block.

And this video shows the walking motion with the block.

The 1mm sketch was the most difficult for me to do, and in the end I wasn't particularly satisfied with the results. My goal was to get a rubber band to oscillate, since the oscillations are in the 1mm range. I wrapped a rubber band around two clothespins hot glued to a cardboard base to make it taut enough that it would oscillate.

I tried three different actuation methods to achieve this.

My first effort was to drop a marble on the rubber band. I built a marble run that would drop the marble on the elastic setup I made.

This didn't work very well, the marble would either go between the elastic's sides or go over the side of it. I decided to try a different actuation method, this time using a pulley system. Next I attempted to use a pulley systemt to knock a cart into the elastic.

This was also a failure, The cart just knocked the whole clothespin setup over because it exerted too much force.

This video shows just how fast the cart was moving.

Finally, I found a spinning clown toy that produced the correct amount of oscillation when spun into the elastic setup.

I am not particularly happy with this final result, I would have preferred something with less direct activation.

Overall this was a very useful exercise in terms of adopting the mindset of building and testing and I look forward to lab 2!
