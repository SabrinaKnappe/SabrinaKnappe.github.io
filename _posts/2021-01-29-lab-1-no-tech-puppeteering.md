For this lab, we were tasked with making three no-tech human actuated sketches that produce different type of motion. One should move 1mm, one 10mm, and one 100mm. I started by drawing out some ideas.

Next, I gathered my materials for further inspiration.

Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?
