In this lab, we were tasked with setting up our Haply device, getting the software running, and modifying an existing example to make our own maze. I ran into a few issues during assembly, the biggest one being that the screwdriver included in the Haply kit was too small for the screws. I ended up buying a T6 screwdriver at home depot which did the trick.
